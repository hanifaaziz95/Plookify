Installation instructions:
The application can be opened by double clicking on the Plookify.jar file which is located in the release folder of the file.
The application runs on Windows on the ITL computers. 

How to use:
The use can be logged in using the log in details listed below for 5 different accounts. When the user has logged in, they 
can access the track player, where they are able to search for songs by artist and genre. The user can add or remove tracks to the now 
playing playlist. The user may also adjust the volume at which the song is playing at by using the volume slider located at the bottom right.
The song currently playing may be paused/played from the button located the bottom left, next to this button is the skip current song button,
which will skip to the next song in the playlist. The current song time and length of song is displayed at the bottom next to the time slider and may be changed 
with input by the user, by either dragging the time slider at the bottom or clicking the "jump to..." button and inputting the time (format "m ss") 
they wish the song to change to. The details of the current song playing is located at the bottom right, and changes accordingly. At the top of the 
window is a search bar with instructions, three different ways to search for tracks are presented in the form of buttons "Song","Genre","Artist". 
The user must enter a search term and  click one of these buttons to search the database. The results will be displayed in a table directly below the search bar. 
The bottom table presents the tracks in the current playlist. When songs are added from the top table (by double clicking a track), they are added to the current
playlist and displayed in the table. Songs may be removed from the current playlist by double clicking the track. There is a button alongside the 
top table which will allow users to add all resulting songs from the search to the playlist. Buttons are displayed on the right
"My Account", "Playlist","Radio" and these buttons link to the other features presented in "Plookify". There is a sign out button, so users may sign
out of their account. The track player actually plays mp3s, but only those stored in the folder. (There are only 6 tracks currently, to avoid a large
file size).

The user can click on playlist whereby the window will change to the Playlist Manager window. In this window, the user
can search for an artist. The tracks associated with the artist will be displayed in the table in the middle. The user can click on the,
"New Playlist," button where a window will appear which will allow the user to create a new playlist by first selecting the type of the playlist
from two radio buttons, "Friend," and, "Private," and then naming the playlist and clicking the, "Save," button. The user can click on the, "View
Friends Playlists," and, "View Private Playlists," which will display the, "Friend," type and "Private," type playlists respectively in the left
hand table. The user can view the playlist's tracks by selecting the playlist from the left hand table, and the tracks will appear in the right
hand table. After selecting a playlist, the user can rename the playlist, by selecting the, "Rename Playlist," button, which will make a window 
appear allowing the user to enter the new name for the playlist in a text field and then clicking the, "Save," button. The user can also select 
a playlist and add songs to the playlist by first searching for an artist, displaying their related songs and then selecting the, "Add Song to 
Playlist" button. The user can also select a playlist and remove songs from the playlist by first viewing the playlist's tracks, selecting a song
from the playlist and selecting the, "Remove Song from Playlist," button. The user can select the, "Add to Now Playing," button after selecting a
track, which will add the selected track to the, "now playing," playlist. The, "Back," button will take the user back to the landing page.
All "pop-up" windows are closed from the buttons of the window.
To refresh the Friends and Private playlists after creating or renaming a playlist
you must select the view button for the opposite playlist then select back the button which views the original type of playlist.

From the track player, the user can access their account details by clicking on My Account.For a free user the right panel displays an options to become a subscribed user. The button that allows this is a dummy button so it does not actually write to the database to make the customer a subscriber.

After 5 has been added the user can replace devices, buttons will appear near each row of the table. The left panel contains the button for closing an account. On click it exits the application and deletes user from database.
